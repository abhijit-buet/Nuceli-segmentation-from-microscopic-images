<h1> Nuclei-segmentation-from-microscopic-images
<h6>Nuclei segmentation from microscopic images was a task given in National Data Science Bowl 2018.
The task contained images of nuclei and required to produce segmented mask of nuclei by an deep learning algorithm.

<h1> Proposed Framework
<h6>
  
 Our proposed framework Consists of a customized U-NET architecture.

We have applied different type of augmentation to the inpute image: 1) Vertical Shifting 2) Horizontal Shifting 3) Random Croping
